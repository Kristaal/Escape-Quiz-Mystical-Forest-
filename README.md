## Design

### Design Choices
The game has been designed to have an exciting and scaring effect on the user. The video as a background was chosen to show the emotions of being in a scary forest and trying to escape and survive. The entire design of the game is based on the atmosphere of the classic horror film.

### Colour
The color palette was chosen to match the horror theme of the background video. A color picker was used to pick colors from the background video, these colors were then further adjusted to meet accessibility criteria and added accent color.

### Fonts
On the platform Google fonts a font "Gloria Hallelujah" was chosen, because the name of the quiz-game would look unusually, frightening and handwriting. I chose "Kalam" font for readability questions and answers.

### Structure
The page structure is user friendly and simple.  When entering the site, the user sees a proposal to start the game. The site consists of one page which changes depending on the function:
- A home page with name of the game and button "Start";
- A rules page, whick shows rules of the game for user;
- A question page with quiz;
- A result page, that shows the result of the game.
